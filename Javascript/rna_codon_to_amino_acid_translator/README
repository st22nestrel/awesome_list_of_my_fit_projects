# RNA Codon to Amino Acid Translator

## About

This project implements a genetic code translation system that converts RNA codons into their corresponding amino acids. It provides functionality to:

- Translate RNA sequences into amino acids
- Handle all standard amino acid codons
- Process stop codons (UGA, UAA, UAG)
- Validate input sequences


Features:
- Supports all 20 standard amino acids
- Implements inheritance-based amino acid objects
- Provides generator-based translation
- Includes error handling for invalid codons
- Returns amino acid objects with proper prototypal inheritance

- *project*: Project 1

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.18.0 was used during development)
- JSDoc (for documentation generation)

### How to run

1. Install dependencies
```bash
./test.sh --install
```

2. Run tests
```bash
./test.sh
```

3. Generate documentation
```
./doc.sh
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Documentation generation requires JSDoc. If not installed, you can install it globally using: `npm install -g jsdoc`.
